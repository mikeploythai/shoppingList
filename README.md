# CLI Shopping List ðŸ“ƒ
On February 17th, 2022, acmCSUF held an introduction to Python workshop under their acmDev path to introduce students to the world's most popular programming language. The student project for the event was to make a simple shopping list app that runs in the command line. It was very barebones, and the only function it had was to input an item into a list, which users can print out.

I got bored on a Friday, so I wanted to practice some Python and expand upon this simple project. It kept me busy for a good hour, so that's cool.

#### FEATURES ðŸŒŸ
- View List: View your shopping list. If the list is empty, it'll return an error and prompt users to go back to the start screen; else, it'll print out the entire shopping list array.
- Add to List: Users indicate how many items they plan to add to the list. After, users input the name of the item(s), which gets appended to the shopping list array.
- Delete an Item: Show the current list of items, and prompt the user to input which item they want to delete from the list.
- Delete List: Clear the entire list.
- Export List: Export your shopping list with the date of export as a .txt file.

#### WHAT DID I LEARN ðŸ’¡
While working on this project, I've learned exactly why Python is often regarded as one of the best programming languages for anyone to pick up: Python is straight up <i>easy</i> and <i>simple</i>. Might be surprising that I've only just realized this, but that's because most of my general programming work revolves around C++ (Archaic, I know. I'm in the process of picking up Go lol).

The beautiful part about it is that Python can be used for both simple applications, like this one, as well as complex ones that deal with data science and machine learning, which alone shows exactly why Python is amazing, and why Python is used so often to make cool things.

Still think JavaScript is the absolute best language for beginners though :P
